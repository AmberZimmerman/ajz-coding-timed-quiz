### Description of the project:

A silly little quiz about flamingos using vanilla javascript and html/css.
Once you start the quiz, you will have 75 seconds to answer
five questions about our pink feathered friends. You can only select
an answer once and you can not exit the quiz once it is started.
Everytime you select a wrong answer, 10 seconds will be deducted from
the clock. When you answer all five questions, or once the timer
reaches 0, the game will be over. The time that remains on the clock
once the game ends will be your final score.

Enter in your initials and save your highscore!
